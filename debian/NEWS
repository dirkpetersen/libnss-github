libnss-redis (0.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  Since version 0.3 libnss-redis adds an exception for users
  with group id 100, which are now allowed even though 100 is less
  than the built-in MINGID of 500.

  100 is the gid of the "users" group on Debian machines, thus this
  change should hopefully not hurt anyone, but make this package
  useful for more people.

  If you want to continue to exclude users with group 100, you will
  have to recompile libnss-redis, as the global usage of nss
  modules makes config files to expensive. (just removing the USERSGID
  line from s_config.h should suffice).
